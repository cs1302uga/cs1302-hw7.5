This class exercise explores creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the JavaFX library. Students
will create an interactive GUI that loads an image from a specified URL. The program supports images in BMP, 
GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats. In this exercise, starter code containing the basic layout of a JavaFX application
is provided. Implementation details are left to the student.

## Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO2.e:** (Partial) Utilize existing generic methods, interfaces, and classes in a software solution.
* **LO7.a:** (Partial) Design and implement a graphical user interface in a software project.

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Odin server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Odin into a subdirectory called `cs1302-hw7.5`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw7.5.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-hw7.5` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```

## Exercise Steps

### Checkpoint 1 Steps

In this checkpoint, you will focus on creating the basic GUI layout for the `ImageApp`. Don't worry about
adding functionality to the button just yet.  At the end of the checkpoint, your GUI should look like the
following image:

<img src="https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw7.5/blob/master/ScreenShot.png?raw=true" width=300>

1. Consider the following containment heirarchy:

   ```
                                        --|
                         Stage            |
                           |              |
                         Scene            |
          |--              |              |
          |               VBox            | Overall
          |               / \             | Containment
   Scene  |              /   \            | Hierarchy
   Graph  |            HBox  ImageView    |
          |            / \                |
          |           /   \               |
          |    TextField  Button          |
          |--                           --|
   ```
   
   Each node corresponds to an object of some class under the 
   [`javafx`](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/)
   package. The diagram for the scene graph assumes that child nodes
   are added to their parents in a left-to-right order. For example,
   the `HBox` and `ImageView` objects are added to the collection of
   child nodes for the `VBox` object in that order.
   
1. **Compile and run the starter code without any errors or warnings.**
   Specify `bin` as the default package for your compiled code.
   
   * If you have trouble running the starter code, then consult the 
     [CSCI 1302 JavaFX Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/javafx/javafx.md).
     
1. The contents of the scene represent part of the state of your application.
   As such, the variables that we use to refer to those objects should be
   instance variables of your class. Don't add the instance variables yet. First, consult the 
   [API Documentation](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/) and 
   [referenced bookmarks](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/javafx/javafx-bookmarks.md)
   to determine the **import statements** that are needed, then add them to
   the file for your `ImageApp` class. **Recompile before continuing.** 
   
1. Stage and commit your changes.

1. Now, for each object in the scene graph, declare an **instance variable** 
   of the appropriate type with a good name. Do not create the objects here!
   
1. In the `start` method, construct the objects for the scene graph in
   a top-down fashion, assigning their references to the instance variables
   that you just declared. 
   
   1. Consult the 
      [API Documentation](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/) and 
      for each class to see what constructors are available.
      
   1. Try to make the text content of visible nodes match the screenshot.
      
   1. For the `ImageView` object, we would like for you to create a separate
      [`Image`](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/Image.html)
      object and use the 
      [`ImageView(Image)`](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/ImageView.html#%3Cinit%3E(javafx.scene.image.Image)) constructor. 
      The URL string that you should provide to the `Image` constructor is:
   
      ```
      "http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/gui/default.png"
      ```
      
      **NOTE:** Do not use the `ImageView` constructor that directly takes a URL string.
      If you do, then it will make it potentially more difficult to change the image
      in a later step.
  
   1. Add any child nodes to their parent's 
      collection of children using `getChildren().add`. 
      
   1. **Recompile and run.**

1. Make sure your code passes the `checkstyle` audit, then stage and commit all changes.

1. If you completed the steps correctly, your app should look similar to
   the screenshot provided above. Congratulations on a good looking app!

### Checkpoint 2 Steps

Now that you have your app looking good, let's make it do stuff!

1. In the `start` method of your `ImageApp` class, declare a variable
   of type `EventHandler<ActionEvent>` called `loadHandler`, then assign
   to it, using a lambda expression, an implementation of
   `EventHandler<ActionEvent>` that prints out the text of the
   `TextField` to standard output (i.e., the terminal).
   **Recompile before continuing.**
   
   * Take special care that you import the correct `ActionEvent` class,
     as a quick Internet search may recommend the wrong one!
     Consult the 
    [API Documentation](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/) and 
    [referenced bookmarks](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/javafx/javafx-bookmarks.md)
     to determine the import statements that are needed.
     
1. Once your app is able to print the text from the `TextField` to 
   standard output, ammend the code so that is also creates an `Image`
   object using the supplied URL, then sets the `image` propery of
   the `ImageView` using the appropriated setter method.
   **Recompile before continuing.**
   
   * Here are some URLs to try when testing your program:
   
     * `http://csweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/gui/pikachu.png`
     * `http://csweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/gui/brad.jpg`
     * `http://csweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/gui/SuccessKid.jpg`
   
   * **We will check this:** 
     Your program should not crash when supplied invalid input. Use
     exception handling, as needed, to make the experience nicer
     for the user. While we will explore creating popup windows
     and dialogs in the future, it is sufficient to print a friendly
     error message to standard output instead of letting the
     program crash or display a stack trace.
     
1. Make sure your code passes the `checkstyle` audit, then stage and commit all changes.

1. If you completed the steps correctly, your app should not only look 
   similar to the screenshot provided above, but it has the desired
   functionality. Congratulations on a good looking, functional app!
